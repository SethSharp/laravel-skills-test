1. How long did you spend to complete this test?
    Not too long, about an hour or so
2. What was easy?
    Setting up the Post form and sending the information to the controller
3. What was hard?
    The hardest part was setting up the project. Forking and cloning was the easy part
    but when it came to installing the dependencys there were a few extra things
    I needed to do which I haven't done before. Which I had help to complete. Image upload
    also caused some problems to overcome
